Phase 2 diff Explanations

[add any other possible diffs here]

test13: The difference in output is a result of the difference between the
machine that was used to run the sample output and the machine used to run our
code. Every time we receive a clock interrupt, our interrupt handler checks to
see if 100 milliseconds has passed, and if that is the case, then it calls the
dispatcher. The status given to XXp1, which is waiting on the clock interrupt,
is the time elapsed between the last clock interrupt and the current one. The
testcase states that it should be around 100,000. However, the exact number
will vary based on the machine itself, and the testcase explicitly states that
we do not have to exactly match the test output (since this is nearly 
impossible unless we run the code on the exact same machine that was used to
generate the test output, which is also close to impossible). This is the only
cause of diff output for this testcase. Therefore, we believe that our 
implementation is correct and that the difference in output that we see is
acceptable.
