Phase 3 diff Explanations

test10
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This testcase deals with the current system time, which is difficult to match exactly.
The testcase code spawns 3 children, Child1a, Child1b, and Child1c, which perform some
calculations and print out the current time intermittently. In all 3 children, our
printed times are close but not identical to the example output; thus it can be 
assumed that our output is still a correct example of the program running.

test20
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This testcase deals with semaphores. It starts by creating a semaphore with a initial
value of 3, and decrements it with P. It then creates Child1 with a priority of 2;
since this is a higher priority than the main method (which has 3) the dispatch
context switches to it. It tries to decrement the semaphore 5 times with P, but blocks
on the third try since the value was only 2 when it started. Now that the testcase
main is back in control, it creates Child2 with a priority of 3. But since the
priorities are the same, the dispatcher may or may not actually context switch into it
right away. Both the testcase main and Child2 use V to increment the semaphore and
wake up Child1 (if needed), but the order in which this happens could be different. In
our output, the dispatch does not context switch into Child2 and the testcase main
continues, and the example output does the opposite, which makes the output appear
slightly different. The example output even mentions this and has a message indicating
that these two lines could be swapped, thus it can be assumed that our output is still
valid.
