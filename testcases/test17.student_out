testcase_main(): started
EXPECTATION: testcase_main() will create 3 children, all running XXp1().  They have priority 3, so that they will not interrupt testcase_main().  The PID of each child is stored into a global array.  Then testcase_main() blocks in join() (three times).  The child processes should run in the same order they were created (we use a FIFO for ordering dispatch), and so each can call getpid() to confirm that it has the same value as stored in the global array.
