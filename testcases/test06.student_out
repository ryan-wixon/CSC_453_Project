testcase_main(): started
EXPECTATION: Create XXp1 (moderate priority); that creates 2 XXp2 children (low priority).  XXp1 will block on join(), which will cause main() to wake up and report the fork() results - after which the XXp2 processes will run.
XXp1(): started
XXp1(): arg = 'XXp1'
XXp1(): executing fork of first child
XXp1(): spork of first child returned pid = 4
XXp1(): executing fork of second child
XXp1(): spork of second child returned pid = 5
XXp1(): performing first join
testcase_main(): after fork of child 3 -- you should not see this until after XXp1() has created both of its children, and started its first join().  However, you should see it *before* either of the children run.
testcase_main(): performing join
XXp2(): started -- you should not see this until both XXp1() and testcase_main() are blocked in join().
XXp2(): arg = 'XXp2'
XXp2(): This process will terminate immediately.
atempting to quit: pid 4
XXp1(): first join returned kidpid = 4, status = 5 -- you should see this after the first child terminates, and before the second child even starts.
XXp1(): performing second join
XXp2(): started -- you should not see this until both XXp1() and testcase_main() are blocked in join().
XXp2(): arg = 'XXp2'
XXp2(): This process will terminate immediately.
atempting to quit: pid 5
XXp1(): second join returned kidpid = 5, status = 5
atempting to quit: pid 3
testcase_main(): exit status for child 3 is 3
atempting to quit: pid 2
finish(): The simulation is now terminating.
