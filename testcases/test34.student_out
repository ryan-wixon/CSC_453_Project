QUICK SUMMARY: Attempt to call zap() on a process that has already terminated, but whose parent has not yet called join().
XXp1(): started
XXp1(): arg = 'XXp1'
XXp1(): after fork of child 4
XXp1(): after fork of child 5
XXp1(): performing first join
testcase_main(): after fork of child 3
testcase_main(): performing first join
XXp3(): started
XXp3(): arg = 'XXp3'
XXp3(): calling zap(4)
XXp2(): started
XXp2(): arg = 'XXp2'
XXp2(): exiting by calling quit(2)
XXp1(): exit status for first child 4 is 2
XXp1(): performing second join
XXp3(): zap(4) returned
XXp1(): exit status for second child 5 is 3
testcase_main(): exit status for child 3 is 1
finish(): The simulation is now terminating.
