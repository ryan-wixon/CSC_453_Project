testcase_main(): started
EXPECTATION: Same general test as test13/test14, except that now XXp1() zaps its own child, AND XXp2() will zap the same.  The sequence is thus (1) testcase_main creates XXp1 (2) XXp1 creates XXp3 (3) XXp1 blocks zapping XXp3 (4) testcase_main creates XXp2 (5) XXp2 blocks zapping XXp3 (6) testcase_main and XXp3 race (7) XXp3 calls dumpProcesses and then dies (8) XXp1 and XXp2 unblock (9) XXp1 join()s and then terminates (10) XXp2 terminates (11) testcase_main cleans up
testcase_main(): first fork -- XXp1 will run next.
XXp1(): started
XXp1(): arg = 'XXp1'
XXp1(): executing fork of first child
XXp1(): spork of first child returned pid = 4
XXp1(): zap'ing process with pid_z=4
testcase_main(): after fork of first child 3 -- you should not see this until XXp1() blocks in zap()
testcase_main(): second fork -- XXp2 will run next.
XXp3(): started
 PID  PPID  NAME              PRIORITY  STATE
   1     0  init              6         Runnable
   2     1  testcase_main     3         Runnable
   3     2  XXp1              1         Blocked(waiting for zap target to quit)
   4     3  XXp3              3         Running
XXp3(): terminating -- when this happens, XXp1() and XXp2() will both become runnable, because both are blocked in zap().  XXp1() will run first, because it is higher priority.
XXp1(): after zap'ing process with pid_z=4
XXp1(): joining with child -- this will NOT block, because the child has already ended.
XXp1(): join returned kidpid = 4, status = 5
XXp1(): terminating -- when this happens, XXp2() will run, because it is higher priority than testcase_main().
XXp2(): started
XXp2(): zap'ing process with pid_z=4 -- at this point, testcase_main() and XXp3() will race.
ERROR: Attempt to zap() a non-existent process.
finish(): The simulation is now terminating.
