testcase_main(): started
EXPECTATION: Similar to test03 (create a few processes, join with them, do it again) - but this one will run many iterations of the loop.  Also, each child will have a tight spin loop.  And finally, dumpProcesses() will be called from a child instead of testcase_main().
testcase_main(): calling fork(), arg_buf = 'XXp1_0' -- testcase_main() will block until this child terminates, because the child is higher priority.
XXp1(): XXp1_0, started, pid = 3
