testcase_main(): started
EXPECTATION: Similar to test15, except that XXp2() will zap() XXp1() while XXp1() is also zap()ping XXp3().
testcase_main(): first fork -- XXp1 will run next.
XXp1(): started
XXp1(): arg = 'XXp1'
XXp1(): executing fork of first child -- XXp1() will continue to run, because XXp3 is very low priority.
XXp1(): spork of first child returned pid = 4
XXp1(): zap'ing process with 4 -- this will block until XXp3() dies.  Therefore, we expect testcase_main() to run next.
