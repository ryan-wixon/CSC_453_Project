testcase_main(): started
QUICK SUMMARY: Same as test27, except with different priorities - which means that pid3 is not set by the time that XXp2() attempts to use it.
testcase_main(): after fork of child 3
testcase_main(): after fork of child 4
testcase_main(): after fork of child 5
testcase_main(): performing first join
XXp1(): started
XXp1(): arg = 'XXp1'
testcase_main(): exit status for child 3 is 1
testcase_main(): performing second join
XXp2(): started
XXp2(): arg = 'XXp2'
XXp2(): calling zap(5)
XXp3(): started
XXp3(): arg = 'XXp3'
XXp4(): started
XXp4(): arg = 'XXp4FromXXp3a'
XXp3(): after fork of child 6
XXp3(): performing first join
XXp3(): exit status for child 6 is 4
testcase_main(): exit status for child 5 is 3
testcase_main(): performing third join
XXp2(): zap(5) returned
testcase_main(): exit status for child 4 is 2
finish(): The simulation is now terminating.
