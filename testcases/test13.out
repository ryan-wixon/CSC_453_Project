testcase_main(): started
EXPECTATION: testcase_main() creates child XXp1(), priority 1.  It creates its own child, XXp3(), priority 3.  It stores the pid of the XXp3() child into a global, and then blocks on join().  testcase_main() wakes up and creates another child, XXp2(), priority 2.  This calls zap() on the pid stored in the global variable, meaning that *two* processes are now blocked on the same XXp3().  XXp3() and testcase_main() race; XXp3() will call dumpProcesses() and die, while testcase_main() will join().  When XXp3() dies, XXp1() and XXp2() will both be awoken but XXp1() will run first.
testcase_main(): fork first child -- this will block, because the child has a higher priority
XXp1(): started
XXp1(): arg = 'XXp1'
XXp1(): executing fork of child
XXp1(): spork of child returned pid = 4
XXp1(): joining with child -- when we block here, testcase_main() should wake up so that it can create its second child.
testcase_main(): after fork of child 3 -- you should not see this until XXp1() is blocked in join().
testcase_main(): fork second child -- this will block, because the child has a higher priority
XXp2(): started
XXp2(): zap'ing XXp1's child with pid_e=4 -- when we block here, testcase_main() and XXp3() will race.
